# Chaotic-pRNG
pRNG based on a chaotic system which exhibits high lyapunov exponents for a big range of mu, the constant of the system. The system is a version which combines the tent map and the sine map. Both exhibit chaotic behaviour independently, but when put together better results were obtained.
